In this project is build a regression model using the Keras library to model the data about concrete compressive strength. 

This project is developed as a Final Project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras on Coursera (link to the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras)

The dataset (concrete_data.csv) for the project was provided by the course creators.
